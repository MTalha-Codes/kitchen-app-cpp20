# Roob's  Kitchen App 
This is a CLI kitchen app I built with C++20, while I was bored and thinking about a new feature to add in [**mmqlc**](https://github.com/MTalha-Codes/mmqlc).
## Features
- User Authentication System
- Menu Tracking System

## User Authentication System
The **UAS** system is simple and basic user authentication system that stores raw user credentials in file using fstream and filesystem.

## Menu Tracking System
This app is capable of tracking the menu of the user, if payment has not been done yet !.
